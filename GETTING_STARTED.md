# Getting Started with DSA in Dart

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms with Dart repository! This guide will help you get started with understanding the repository structure, setting up your environment, and making the most out of the resources provided.

## Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you'll need:

1. **Dart SDK**: Install the latest version of Dart from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

2. **IDE/Editor**: Any text editor will work, but we recommend:

   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Dart extension
   - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with the Dart plugin
   - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the Dart plugin

3. **Basic Dart Knowledge**: Familiarity with Dart syntax and concepts will be helpful

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by algorithm patterns, with each pattern having:

```
Pattern Name/
  ├── Theory/
  │   └── README.md (theory explanation)
  └── Questions/
      ├── Easy/
      │   └── problem1.dart
      │   └── problem2.dart
      ├── Medium/
      │   └── problem1.dart
      └── Hard/
          └── problem1.dart
```

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Study the Theory

Each pattern folder contains a `Theory` directory with a README.md file explaining:

- What the pattern is
- When to use it
- Time and space complexity
- Common variations and applications
- Code templates

Start by reading these theory files to understand the core concepts.

### 2. Progress Through Problems

Progress through the practice problems in order of difficulty:

1. Start with **Easy** problems to grasp basic applications
2. Move on to **Medium** problems once you're comfortable
3. Challenge yourself with **Hard** problems to master advanced applications

### 3. Run the Code

To run any Dart file:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository root
cd dsa-with-dart

# Run a specific file
dart run "Sliding Window/Questions/Easy/max_sum_subarray.dart"
```

### 4. Understand the Solution Structure

Each problem file is structured as follows:

- Problem statement with examples
- Solution implementation with detailed comments
- Step-by-step execution trace for example input
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Test cases to verify the solution

## Study Tips

1. **Active Learning**: Don't just read the code. Try to understand each line, run it, modify it, and observe the effects.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for similarities between problems. Recognizing patterns is key to applying the right technique.

3. **Implement Twice**:

   - First implementation: Follow the provided solution
   - Second implementation: Try to solve it from memory without looking at the solution

4. **Review & Reflect**: After solving a problem, ask yourself:

   - Why was this algorithm pattern chosen?
   - What other approaches could work?
   - How could the solution be optimized further?

5. **Spaced Repetition**: Return to problems you've already solved after a few days to reinforce your understanding.

## Common Algorithm Pattern Summary

Here's a quick reference for when to use each pattern:

| Pattern              | When to Use                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Sliding Window       | Contiguous subarrays/substrings with constraints    |
| Two Pointers         | Sorted arrays, pair finding, palindromes            |
| Fast & Slow Pointers | Cycle detection, linked list manipulations          |
| Prefix Sum           | Range queries, cumulative operations                |
| Hash Map/Set         | Frequency counting, lookups                         |
| Binary Search        | Sorted data, finding boundary conditions            |
| DFS/BFS              | Tree/graph traversal, shortest path                 |
| Backtracking         | Generate all possibilities, constraint satisfaction |
| Greedy               | Local optimization with global implications         |
| Dynamic Programming  | Overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure       |
