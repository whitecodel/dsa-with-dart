    "options": [
        "It allows efficient two-pointer traversal and helps avoid duplicate triplets",
        "It reduces the problem to a simpler one-pointer approach",
        "It makes the time complexity O(n) instead of O(nÂ²)",
        "It ensures the triplets in the result are in ascending order"
