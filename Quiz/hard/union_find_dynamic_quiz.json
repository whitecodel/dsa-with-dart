    "question": "In the 'Number of Islands II' problem where land cells are added dynamically, why is Union Find more suitable than a DFS/BFS approach?",
    "options": [
        "Union Find efficiently handles incremental changes to the grid and tracks connected components",
        "Union Find requires less memory than running DFS/BFS after each new land cell",
        "Union Find guarantees O(1) time complexity for each new land cell",
        "DFS/BFS cannot identify islands in a grid structure"
    ],
