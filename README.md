# Data Structures and Algorithms with Dart

This repository is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implementations in Dart, organized by common algorithm patterns. It's designed to help developers practice and prepare for technical interviews, competitive programming, and improve their understanding of algorithmic concepts.

## Live Website

You can view the live website for this repository at [dsa-with-dart](https://daswithdart.whitecodel.com/). The website provides an interactive way to explore the algorithm patterns, their theory, and the associated problems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by algorithm patterns, with each pattern having:

- **Theory**: Markdown files explaining the concepts, use cases, and complexity analysis.
- **Questions**: Implementation of problems categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

## Algorithm Patterns

The following algorithm patterns are covered:

1. **Sliding Window**

   - For problems involving contiguous subarrays/substrings

2. **Two Pointers**

   - For problems dealing with sorted arrays, palindromes, or pair finding

3. **Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise & Hare)**

   - For cycle detection or problems requiring different traversal speeds

4. **Prefix Sum / Difference Array**

   - For efficiently calculating range sums or modifications

5. **Hash Map / Set (Frequency Counters)**

   - For problems requiring frequency counting or efficient lookups

6. **Binary Search**

   - For problems involving sorted data or when search space can be halved

7. **DFS / BFS (Graph or Tree Traversal)**

   - For problems involving graph or tree structures

8. **Backtracking**

   - For problems requiring exploration of all potential solutions

9. **Greedy**

   - For problems where local optimal choices lead to global solution

10. **Heap / Priority Queue**

    - For problems involving finding k smallest/largest elements or scheduling

11. **Union-Find / DSU**

    - For problems involving disjoint sets or connectivity queries

12. **Bit Manipulation**

    - For problems that can leverage binary operations for optimization

13. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**

    - For problems requiring optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems

14. **Topological Sort**

    - For problems involving dependencies or ordering in directed acyclic graphs

15. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
    - For problems involving string searches or prefix matching

## Problem Organization

Each pattern includes a set of problems categorized by difficulty:

- **Easy**: Foundational problems focusing on the basic application of the pattern
- **Medium**: Intermediate problems requiring a deeper understanding
- **Hard**: Complex problems requiring advanced application and optimization

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start by reading the theory for a pattern you want to learn
2. Try implementing the easy problems before moving to medium and hard ones
3. Run the code locally and experiment with different inputs
4. Study the detailed comments to understand the step-by-step approach

## Running the Code

To run any Dart file in this repository:

```bash
dart run /path/to/file.dart
```
